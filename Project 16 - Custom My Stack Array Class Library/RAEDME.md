# 📚 Custom Stack Array Class Library

Welcome to the **Custom Stack Array Class Library**! 🚀

This C++ project is all about crafting a custom stack using arrays, delving deep into data structures and object-oriented programming. It's not just about code—it's about exploring the elegance and efficiency that thoughtful design can bring to software development. 🌟

## 🔥 Features

- **Dynamic Stack Implementation**: Utilize dynamic arrays to create a flexible stack. 📈
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Leverage inheritance and polymorphism for clean and reusable code. 🛠️
- **Template Class**: Generic programming with templates to handle any data type. 🔣
- **Custom Insertion Methods**: Insert elements at both the top and bottom of the stack. 🔄
- **Integration with Queue Class**: Inherits from `clsMyQueueArr`, showcasing the relationship between stacks and queues. 🔁

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, Visual Studio) 🖥️
- Basic understanding of C++ templates and inheritance 👨‍🎓
- Familiarity with data structures like stacks and queues 📚

### 🚀 Usage

Here's how you can get started with the `clsMyStackArr` class:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "clsMyStackArr.h"

int main() {
    clsMyStackArr<int> myStack;

    // Push elements onto the stack
    myStack.push(1);
    myStack.push(2);
    myStack.push(3);

    // Access the top element
    std::cout << "Top Element: " << myStack.Top() << std::endl; // Output: 3

    // Insert at the bottom
    myStack.InsertAtBottom(0);

    // Pop the top element
    myStack.pop();

    // Access the new top element
    std::cout << "New Top Element: " << myStack.Top() << std::endl; // Output: 2

    return 0;
}
```

## 📖 Class Overview

The `clsMyStackArr` class template extends the functionality of `clsMyQueueArr`, providing a stack implementation with some unique twists.

### 🧩 Public Methods

- `void push(T Value)`: Add an element to the top of the stack. 📥
- `void pop()`: Remove the top element from the stack. 📤
- `T Top()`: Retrieve the top element without removing it. 🔍
- `T Bottom()`: Retrieve the bottom element without removing it. 🧐
- `void InsertAtTop(T Value)`: Insert an element at the top. 🆙
- `void InsertAtBottom(T Value)`: Insert an element at the bottom. 🆓

## 🌟 How It Works

At its core, the stack uses a dynamic array to store elements, providing flexibility and efficient memory usage. By inheriting from the `clsMyQueueArr` class, it demonstrates the interconnectedness of different data structures and how inheritance can be used to build upon existing functionality. This design showcases:

- **Code Reusability**: Leveraging existing code to enhance functionality.
- **Polymorphism**: Ability to use base class pointers to refer to derived class objects.
- **Encapsulation**: Keeping implementation details hidden and exposing only necessary interfaces.

## 🧠 Insights and Inspiration

Stacks are fundamental in computer science, playing crucial roles in algorithms, memory management, and problem-solving techniques. By building this custom stack:

- You're gaining hands-on experience with **data structures**.
- You're applying **object-oriented principles** in a practical context.
- You're enhancing your understanding of **inheritance and templates** in C++.

Think about how stacks are used in function call management, expression evaluation, and even in undo mechanisms in software applications. By mastering stacks, you're adding a powerful tool to your programming arsenal. 🛡️

## 🤖 Extending the Library

Consider experimenting further:

- **Exception Handling**: Add checks and throw exceptions for underflow or overflow conditions.
- **Iterator Implementation**: Allow traversal through the stack elements.
- **Persistent Storage**: Integrate file handling to save and load stack states.

The more you tinker, the more you'll discover the endless possibilities that programming offers. It's like composing music—each line of code contributes to a symphony of functionality. 🎼
